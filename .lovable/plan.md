# Fix: Inch Symbol Breaks CSV Import Parsing

## Problem
The template generated by `downloadTemplate()` contains inch symbols (`"`) such as `8"`, `16"`, `36" x 36"`. PapaParse uses `"` as the CSV quote character by default, so these inch marks cause it to misparse rows entirely. Even the app's own template can't be re-uploaded.

## Solution
Add `quoteChar: '\0'` (null character) to the `Papa.parse()` call to effectively disable quote-character handling. PapaParse doesn't accept `false` for `quoteChar`, but setting it to a character that will never appear in the data achieves the same effect.

## Changes

**File: `src/components/ecfi/ImportCatalogItems.tsx`**

1. In the `Papa.parse()` call (~line 215), add `quoteChar: '\0'` to disable quote parsing:

```typescript
Papa.parse(file, {
  header: true,
  skipEmptyLines: true,
  quoteChar: '\0',  // disable — inch symbol " conflicts with CSV quoting
  complete: async (results) => {
    // ... existing logic unchanged
  }
});
```

No changes needed to the template or any other logic. The template already produces valid unquoted CSV -- it just couldn't be parsed back because of the quote character conflict.

## Verification
After the fix: download the template, immediately re-upload it. All rows should parse with zero errors.
